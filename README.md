# Advent of Code

This repository includes my code for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)

Just heard about this and it could be a nice thing to do every year. No optimizations or clever solutions, brute forcing my way through these ðŸ˜¤

## Running from the command line

To compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript 
```
npx tsc
```

To run the JavaScript
```
node '.\Day 1\solution.js'
```
